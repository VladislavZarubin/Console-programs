# Programs
 Some of my console programs
1. TEXTMONTH - a small program that gives the name of the month in text by the entered number. Has the ability to choose the language between Russian and English. More languages can be added later!
2. CHECKPASSWORD - a program that checks the entered password for reliability. A password is considered strong if it has more than 8 characters and contains at least one lowercase and at least one uppercase letter.
3. CORRECTBRACKET - a program that takes any expression with brackets as input and checks that all open brackets are closed.
